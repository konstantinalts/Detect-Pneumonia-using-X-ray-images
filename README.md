# Detect Pneumonia from bacteria or virus using chest X-ray images

The purpose of the assignment was to implement a machine learning model that would be trained in order to classify as accurately as possible  X-ray images into 3 classes: (a) normal, (b) bacterial pneumonia, (c) viral pneumonia. The results of the model were submitted in the Kaggle Detect Pneumonia (Fall 2021) competition.
